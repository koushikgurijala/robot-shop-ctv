## HOW DOES CTV HELP IN ENGINEERING PRODUCTIVITY
Continuous Testing Vision is all about integrating various testing methodologies in the Release pipeline to acheive the goals of 
1. Decreasing the Lead Time for Changes (to One Day)
2. Increasing the Deployment Frequency (Multiple Deployments Per Day)
3. Minimizing Change failure rate (<0.15%)
