<!-- STEP1 -->
<h3 id="step1"> üî∞ STEP1: General Setup Instructions</h3>

1. **Generate a GITHUB TOKEN (We need this to get the Pull Request(PR) Information and publish reports back to Github PR)**
 * Go to your GITHUB Account (Not the Repo) 
 * ‚û°Ô∏è Settings ‚û°Ô∏è Then Scroll down to the end, Go to Developer Settings
 * ‚û°Ô∏è Go to Personal access token
 * ‚û°Ô∏è Generate a new token ‚û°Ô∏è Configure SSO 
 * ‚û°Ô∏è Copy the **token**.
 * ‚û°Ô∏è After you obtain GitHub Personal Access Token, Come to your **GitHub Repo**, 
 * ‚û°Ô∏è Click on Settings Tab ‚û°Ô∏è visit Security ‚û°Ô∏è Secrets ‚û°Ô∏è Actions, then 
 * ‚û°Ô∏è Add a secret and name it **GITHUB_TOKEN**  and in the value field paste the **token** you obtained from the above(1st) step

2. **Request Google Cloud COE Team for creation of Google Artifact Registry (This is needed for storing your Build artifacts)**
* ‚û°Ô∏è Identify a project name, Ex: trianngulum-ctv for this app
* ‚û°Ô∏è Identiy a location or obtain the location from the Google Cloud COE ex: us-central1 or multi-region
* ‚û°Ô∏è Identify a name for the repository and type (maven, gradle, docker etc). It is docker for this project and name is telus-robot-shop (Image name rs-shipping)


* ‚û°Ô∏è Then Create a service principal with write access to Google Artifact Repository
* ‚û°Ô∏è Go to Keys Section and then download the JSON Key

3. **Requestiong GCP Managed Identity Provider Id from Google CCOE Team** 
* GCP Managed Identity Provider is another way of authenticating GitHub actions or any other appliations to Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The only difference between a Service account with a token as secret (Refer https://github.com/telus/triangulum-ctv-telusRobotShop/tree/main/mockitoApp#step1) to using Managed Identity provider is the Service Principal account token is long lived where as Manged Identity provider generated tokens on demand and will expire. Even Managed Identity Provider needs Service Principal account but works as a wrapper to automatically generate and renew the tokens. For more information of setting up Workload Managed Identity Fedration please refer to the link https://github.com/google-github-actions/auth#setup.
* ‚û°Ô∏è In Telus, you should request CCOE team for a managed identity proivider.
* ‚û°Ô∏è Pre-requisites for this are a Project Name in GCP, Service Account in GCP mapped with right roles that define access to the necessary access
* ‚û°Ô∏è Once you obtain the Managed identity provider id , you can directly pass it to the 'google-github-actions/auth@v0' actions as an attribute or setup a GitHub Secret or environment variable and pass it. Below is how we referenced.

``` YAML
 - name: Enable Authentication and Authorization to GCP Services
   uses: "google-github-actions/auth@v0"
   with:
     workload_identity_provider: "${{ secrets.workload_identity_provider }}"
     service_account: 'triangulumadmin@triangulum-ctv.iam.gserviceaccount.com'
     project_id: triangulum-ctv
     token_format: 'access_token'
     
 # Format of Workload/Managed Identity Provider is: 
   projects/<UniqueID>/locations/global/workloadIdentityPool/<Your Managed Identity Provider Pool Name>/providers/<provider_name>
   projects/837319743522/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/triangulum-ctv-mip/providers/ghactions-provider
   
 ```

<h3 id="step2"> üî∞ STEP 2: Maven Setup Instructions for WireMock</h3>

1. **General Info**

WireMock is a framework for mocking responses to LIVE API calls made from client (System Under Test SUT) to an other microservice. Wiremock server acts as the mock Service and responds to a request made via HTTP call by returning JSON key value pairs. For testing this application, we need TestNG or any other similar testing framwork with RestAssure and WireMock Server. We have configured WireMock server as a docker which responds to requests made my SUT.

<p>Under Dependencies section in POM.XML, Add the below</p>

```XML
	<dependency>
	  <groupId>org.testng</groupId>
	    <artifactId>testng</artifactId>
	      <version>7.0.0</version>
		<scope>test</scope>
	</dependency>

	<dependency>
	  <groupId>io.rest-assured</groupId>
	    <artifactId>rest-assured</artifactId>
	      <version>3.3.0</version><!--$NO-MVN-MAN-VER$-->
		 <scope>test</scope>
	</dependency>

	<dependency>
	  <groupId>com.github.tomakehurst</groupId>
	    <artifactId>wiremock-jre8</artifactId>
		<version>2.33.1</version>
		   <scope>test</scope>
	</dependency>

```
2. **TestNG, RestAssured Plugins are used along side WiremMock. Ensure the necessary dependencies and plugins are configured**

- [x] TestNG is used for Test Coverange
- [x] Rest Assured triggers WireMock framework
- [x] WireMock is used for mocking a live Micro Service (Request is processed with a response JSON)

3. **Post Testing, Docker Images are built for deployment to Google Artifact Repository for further deploying to GKE**

After a successful execution of tests, a Docker image is build for the shipping application. Docker file contents are below

```YAML
#
Build Application
#
FROM debian:10 AS build

RUN apt-get update && apt-get -y install maven
WORKDIR /opt/shipping

COPY pom.xml /opt/shipping/
RUN mvn dependency:resolve
COPY src /opt/shipping/src/
RUN mvn package -DskipTests

#
# Run
#
FROM openjdk:8-jdk

EXPOSE 8080
WORKDIR /opt/shipping
ENV CART_ENDPOINT=cart:8080
ENV DB_HOST=mysql

COPY --from=build /opt/shipping/target/shipping-1.0.jar shipping.jar
CMD [ "java", "-Xmn256m", "-Xmx768m", "-jar", "shipping.jar" ]

```

<!-- STEP3 -->
<h3 id="step3"> üî∞ STEP 3: GitHub Actions for WireMock Project</h3>

**Below GitHub Actions will build and push the artifacts to GAR and publish the results to Pull Request(PR) Comments**

```YAML

 # This Job is executed only if there are any changes detected in the Shipping Microservice
 build-shipping:
    name: Building SHIPPING IMAGE
    needs: changes
    if: ${{ needs.changes.outputs.shipping == 'true' }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:

        uses: "google-github-actions/auth@v0"
        with:
          credentials_json: "${{ secrets.GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS }}"
      
      - name: Set up Cloud SDK
        uses: 'google-github-actions/setup-gcloud@v0'
   
      # Download and Run Wiremock Server as a Docker Image
      - name: Run Wiremock server
        run: |
          cd shipping
          docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -v $PWD/src/test/resources:/home/wiremock --name wiremock wiremock/wiremock:2.33.1
          docker container inspect wiremock
          echo `docker container port wiremock`
          mvn test
	  
      # Publish Test Results to Comments in PR
      - name: Publish Wiremock Test Results
        uses: EnricoMi/publish-unit-test-result-action@v1
        if: always()
        with:
          files: "shipping/target/surefire-reports/junitreports/*.xml"
	  
      # Publish Artifacts to GAR
      - name: Build-and-push-to-GAR
        run: |
          echo `pwd`
          export TAG=`cat shipping/VERSION.txt`
          echo $TAG
          echo "$GAR_INFO"/"$SHIPPING_APP_NAME":"$TAG"
          docker build -t "$GAR_INFO"/"$SHIPPING_APP_NAME":"$TAG" shipping/
          gcloud info
          docker push "$GAR_INFO"/"$SHIPPING_APP_NAME":"$TAG"

These reports in the PR comments helps teams to take informed decisions on the code and increases overall engineering productivity. This implementation also rules out the dependency for the System Under Test on other MicroServices. MicroService of interest can be confidently developed, tested and deployed with Service Virtualization.
